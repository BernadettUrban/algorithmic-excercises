/**
 * An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike
 * that took exactly steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, ,
 * or a downhill, step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step
 * up or down represents a unit change in altitude. We define the following
 * terms:
 * 
 * A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with
 * a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
 * A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a
 * step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
 * Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the
 * number of valleys walked through.
 * 
 * Example
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The hiker first enters a valley units deep. Then they climb out and up onto a
 * mountain units high. Finally, the hiker returns to sea level and ends the
 * hike.
 * 
 * Function Description
 * 
 * Complete the countingValleys function in the editor below.
 * 
 * countingValleys has the following parameter(s):
 * 
 * int steps: the number of steps on the hike
 * string path: a string describing the path
 * Returns
 * 
 * int: the number of valleys traversed
